#Below are the basics of python language.
#In python, spaces at the beginning of any line has special meaning.
#A full instruction in python is called a statement.
#A group of statements is called a code.
#A code/group of code in a file makes that file a program.
#A python file is called a script.
#Python is case sensitive for example, "mynum" is not the same as "Mynum".
#Python is an interpreted language for example during execution, python will end on the line where there's an error. It will not stop your statements from running.
#Because of dynamic typing in python, you don't need to specify the datatype of a variable.
mynum = 10
print(mynum)
#int mynum = 10; var mynum =10;...these are used in other programming languages.
#Execution is when your file is being run by the computer.
#A code that has a name and is doing a specific task is called a function.
#In a statement, you'll find a variable name, an operator and a value.
