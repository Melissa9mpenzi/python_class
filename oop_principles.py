#OOP have three principles named; Abstraction, Inheritance,Polymorphism, Encapsulation.

#Abstraction
#in abstract, objects ignore all other things and concentrate on one.i.e "engine". We focus on essential elements and forego the details of less essential elements.
#it's through abstraction that we identify classes and methods.

#Polymorphism
#poly is a greek word that means "many" and morphism means "kinds".
#ability of an object to take on more than one form
#Example of this is the plus(+) operator can be used to sum up two or more numerics or to concantinate.
#to concantinate is to put things together.

name = "Melissa"
print(name + " likes eating pizza" )
#the + implements polymorphism.


#Encapsulation.
#To encapsulate is the ability of the object to hide some implementations/details/properties from others(control what to share with others)
#How we encapsulate:
#privately
#publicly
#protectively

#Inheritance
#To inherit, this is the ability of an object to take on one or more properties of a super class.
#the class where you inherit from is called a super class, parent class, base class.
#the class which inherits is called a child class, sub class, derived class.
#classes grow in number and kind
