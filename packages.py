#in python, a folder with a python script is  called a package.
#there should be one special file that qualifies that folder to be a python package.(with two underscores and init "__init__" and two underscores.py"__.py") This file is usually empty..... __init__.py
#It's important however to have it in a folder that you want to be called a package.
#A module is a python file in a package.
